# Pure JS Typewriter Effect
 
This is a work through of Traversy Media's Sept 27 2018 tutorial.
It will show a rotation of words being "typed" out one letter at a time as part of a <span> element. It uses various timing devices: setTimeout(), typeSpeed, wait for pause.
It also uses data- attributes.

Going to build this two ways for the practice:
First with a Constructor function and Prototype method,
Then using ES6 Class.
